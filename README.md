# Friday Night Funkin' Corruption: REIMAGINED - Alternate Timelines
A Funkin' Corruption Reimagined fan mod where I store random shenanigans I came up using my imagination into 1 singular mod!

This mod is powered by Paper Engine (Psych 0.7.3 fork)!

# Building The Mod

NOTE: YOU NEED TO INSTALL HAXE 4.2.5 IN ORDER TO INSTALL THE HAXE LIBRARIES!!!!

[Haxe 4.2.5 download](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/)

Open the "setup" folder and you should see the .bat files and a SH file

If you're on Windows, follow these steps here:

* Run the "setup-msvc-win.bat" file to install MSVSC (MS Visual Studio Community), this is required as it also installs the necessary components in order to compile the mod

* After MSVSC finished installing, run the "setup-windows.bat" file, this will install all the haxe libraries required to build the mod

* Once all the haxe libraries have been installed, open up the terminal and type either "lime test windows" (release builds) or "lime test windows -debug" (test builds) and press enter, you should now be able to compile the mod (which usually takes about 30 minutes or less if this is the first time compiling, which happens to every other open source FNF mods)

* Once it's done compiling, the game will launch and now you can start modding!

If you're on Mac or Linux, follow these steps here:

* Run the "setup-msvc-win.bat" file to install MSVSC (MS Visual Studio Community), this is required as it also installs the necessary components in order to compile the mod

* After MSVSC finished installing, run the "setup-unix.sh" file, this will install all the haxe libraries required to build the mod

* Once all the haxe libraries have been installed, open up the terminal and type either "lime test windows" (release builds) or "lime test windows -debug" (test builds) and press enter, you should now be able to compile the mod (which usually takes about 30 minutes or less if this is the first time compiling, which happens to every other open source FNF mods)

* Once it's done compiling, the game will launch and now you can start modding!
