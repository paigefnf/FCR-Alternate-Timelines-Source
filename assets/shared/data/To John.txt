Hey John, it's your buddy speaking, I'm writing this email to tell you what are these "alternate universes" or "alternate timelines" I'm seeing in your notebook. I haven't seen you shown up for work in literal MONTHS!! I'm very concerned for you, I'm wondering if something happened in your life or, trying to do something malicious with these experiments that you're doing. In one of the pages of your supposed "workbook", I notice that you mentioned something about a "virus" with some pretty bizarre picture of said virus. Something I want to point out is I hear constant whispers when I was checking through your office, I can't seem to understand what it's trying to say. Look, you need to stop with whatever crazy experiments you're doing because there's already a bunch of cops looking all over for you, if you ever get the chance to see this, please reply back.
